## 🌟 Why Look for RapidAPI Alternatives?

RapidAPI is widely used, but:  

- ❌ Can be expensive for teams scaling up.  
- ❌ Limited flexibility for open-source workflows.  
- ❌ Feature overlap forces developers to use multiple tools.  
- ❌ UI/UX is more marketplace-driven than developer-focused.  

That’s why developers often seek **faster, cheaper, and AI-powered alternatives**.
